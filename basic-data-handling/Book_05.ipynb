    "When we do a **statistical test** we assume a **null hypotesis - H0** and our objective is to try and **falsify** that hypotesis. In most cases the **H0** poses that there is no relationship (or difference) between the **distributions** being tested. To determine if **H0** is false we use the now famous **p-value**. The **p-value** The estimates how probable it is that you would see the differences between the two sets if the null hypothesis were true. Therefore, a p-value of 0.04 means that you have a 4% chance that **H0** is true and thus we report a statistically significant relationship (or difference) between the input and target distributions. Note that it does not say anything a obout how important or biologically relevant it is!\n",
